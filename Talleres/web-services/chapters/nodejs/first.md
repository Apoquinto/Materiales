A web service is a set of protocols and standards that are used to exchange data between applications. Different software applications developed in different programming languages, and executed on any platform, can use web services to exchange data on computer networks such as the internet.  

In a clearer way it could be said that a web service is a function that different services or equipment use; that is, only parameters are sent to the server (where the web service is hosted) and it will respond to the request.
